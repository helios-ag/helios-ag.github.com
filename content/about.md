I'm **Albert Ganiev**, a Senior Software Engineer with over **10 years of experience** building modern web applications.  
I specialize in **PHP (Laravel, Symfony)**, **Golang**, and **Node.js (NestJS, TSOA)**, with a strong focus on **microservice architecture** and backend performance.

I‚Äôve worked with global companies like **Burberry** and **MacroActive**, delivering scalable, production-ready systems.  
I have improved payment integrations (Stripe, Xero), automated SSL and CI/CD workflows, optimized services with caching, and designed feature-rich APIs.

As an active contributor to the open-source community, I maintain several widely used Symfony bundles and Go libraries.  
I value clean code, robust testing, and automation ‚Äî and enjoy solving complex engineering challenges.

üîß I build reliable backend systems, improve performance, automate delivery pipelines, and follow best practices.  
üåç Open to new technologies and international collaboration.
